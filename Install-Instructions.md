2. Slide the adjustment rod through the hole at the ends of the straps making sure that the tabs sticking off of the strap are facing towards the rear of the headphone.

3. Now slide the adjustment arm back into the headband making sure only a little bit is poking through the other end so we can then fold the tabs on the strap over and feed the adjustment rod through the next set of holes.
